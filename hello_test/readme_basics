1. Create a folder for a project (in this case its "hello_test")
2. Inside the folder, create a file to work on Go (in this case filename is "main.go")
3. Write the code. In Go we need to initiate "main" package 1st
4. Then we use "fmt" function which is called for proper formatting
5. Finally we write our logic in the main function
6. Now once the code is complete, we need to open terminal and cd into the folder location (here its "cd .\hello_test\")
7. Here we need to create a module for our code to work. Preferably the module is of same name as the folder using command "go mod init <module name>" (here its "go mod init hello")
8. Once the module is created, we can save our code and run it using command "go run main.go" or "go run ."
9. We can also create binany of our work using command "go build .". This will create a .exe file with same name as the folder where all this is done
10. We can run this binany using command "./<binayname.exe>" (here its "./hello.exe").
11. This binary helps us to run code smoothly afterwards.
